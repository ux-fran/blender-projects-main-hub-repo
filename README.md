# Welcome to the Blender Projects Hub by Fran 43CG! 🎨✨

This repository (a.k.a "a project folder") is the central hub for all my Blender projects. Here, I document my creative journey, showcase progress, and share insights as I develop my skills and explore the endless possibilities of 3D art. Whether you're here for inspiration, learning, or just curiosity—welcome aboard! 🚀

## 🌟 Start Here: The Wiki

The **[Blender-Projects-Repo Wiki](https://github.com/ux-fran/blender-projects-repo/wiki)** is your main starting point. 
I created this Wiki because I can create nice wiki-pages with a more organized way of presenting my projects. 

It offers:
- 🌐 **Project Overviews**: Explore all my active and completed Blender projects, with links to their individual repositories (a.k.a. "project folders")
- 📋 **Progress Updates**: All the projects have their own page on which I dive a little deeper into the making of and links to external resources.
- 🔗 **Links to Individual Repositories**: These repositories contain all the issues (a.k.a "steps"), milestones, goals, and achievements.

👉 **[Visit the Wiki](https://github.com/ux-fran/blender-projects-repo/wiki)** to explore everything!
